SimpleMarketplace
=================

A Simple Marketplace application written in Java using RMI. We had to simulate a marketplace of buying/selling items where users could login. It was part of a course in KTH. This was implemented by me and my colleague Fernando San Juan, I designed the interface and he did the server side.
